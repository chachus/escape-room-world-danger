# Escape-Room World Danger

Software created for an home made Escape Room

This software is composed of 3 main parts:
- Missile Panel
- Hints and Timer
- Control Panel

## Missile Panel
It's a GUI that contains some boxes in which codes must be inserted.
If these codes are correct, the box is deactivated and an action is performed. 
It should represent a missile launch panel.

## Hints and Timer
This script contains the logic of the countdown timer.
It is also possible to make a box appear on the screen containing clues sent from the control panel and a box similar to the logic of the missile panel but represented a biological bomb.
This can also reproduce videos, used to give some plot to the story.

## Control Panel
It is used to control the Hints and Timer screen from the outside via a socket
